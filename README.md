# Sequences Alignment

## Overview 

Adaptation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (which computes a global alignment between sequences) with custom gaps length and associated costs. A description of the initial NW algorithm can be found here : [Needleman–Wunsch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman–Wunsch_algorithm). 


## Time complexity

If the two sequences have length $n$ and $m$
